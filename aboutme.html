         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>I was born in Dallas, Texas in the year 1996. My family moved a lot for my dad's job. We moved to a different town every few years. I believe this is what made me love to travel. After seeing all of Texas, I was ready to explore other states. I lived in beautiful Colorado for a few years, and now I'm enjoying sunny Arizona. I can't wait to continue my travels and see what the rest of the country has to offer. </p>
         <p>Throughout my life I have studied several different topics trying to decide what career to choose. I have always loved computers and technology. However, that is a wide range of options and I didn't know what to pick or how to get into it. </p>
         <p> I was recently diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648" target="_blank">Rheumatoid Arthritis</a> and knew this was the perfect time for a career change. I was finally able to decide that I want to create beautiful websites like the ones that I have always admired. I'm very excited for this new chapter of my life. </p>
